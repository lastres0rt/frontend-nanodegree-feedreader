# Jasmine Unit Testing

This project is the last one of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree, meant to explore Test-Driven Development. The sample project for testing purposes is an RSS feed reader. 

## How to Open the App

[Click here to try it out on github.io.](http://lastres0rt.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/) This will open the project's `index.html` file and run the tests online, which should all pass.

If you are downloading the project to make it run yourself, open the `index.html` file manually after extracting the project.
